# Calendar

We want to manage our events in a calendar.

## Step 1

Allow to add events to a calendar. Events have at least a date, duration and a
title. Example:

* Lunch from 12:00 to 13:00

## Step 2

Make it possible to list all events for a day. 

## Step 3

You cannot split yourself â€“ their may not be more then one event for you at the
same time.

## Step 4

Oh snap, there are different event types. Common events like the lunch date but
also others like birthdays, vacation. The latter ones may of course overlap!

## Step 5

Remember the lunch dates? You do not want to eat lunch alone. So events can
have multiple participants and lunch dates may of course not conflict for any
of the participants.

## Step 6

The customer forgot they need a web service API for this. Expose the calendar
through a simple JSON based HTTP API.
