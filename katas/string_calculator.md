# String Calculator

## Step 1

* Create a simple String calculator with a method int Add(string numbers)
  * The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an
    empty string it will return 0) for example "" or "1" or "1,2"
  * Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two
    numbers
  * Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself
    to write tests you did not think about
  * Remember to refactor after each passing test

## Step 2

* Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

## Step 3

* Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
  * the following input is ok:  "1\n2,3" (will equal 6)
  * the following input is NOT ok:  "1,\n"

## Step 4

* Support different delimiters to change a delimiter, the beginning of the
  string will contain a separate line that looks like this:
  "//[delimiter]\n[numbers"]" for example "//;\n1;2" should return three where
  the default delimiter is ";" .  the first line is optional. all existing
  scenarios should still be supported

## Step 5

* Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception "negatives not
  allowed" - and the negative that was passed.  if there are multiple
  negatives, show all of them in the exception message
